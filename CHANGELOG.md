## 1.2.1
- Fix NPE when not passing default values in rollbar-logback and override stop method to stop the appender [#147](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-java/pull/147)

## 1.2.0
- Added configuration options for `rollbar-web` and `rollbar-android` to specify how IP addresses
  are captured. For `rollbar-web` this is configured via the `capture_ip` filter init parameter.
  This accepts the values: `"full"`, `"anonymize"`, and `"none"`. `"full"` is the default and means
  we capture the full IP address from a request. `"anonymize"` implies that we take the full IP
  address and mask out the least significant bits. `"none"` means we do not capture the IP address
  at all.
  For `rollbar-android` one of the three string values: `"full"`, `"anonymize"`, or `"none"` can be
  passed to the `Rollbar` initializer. Here this refers to how the backend attempts to capture the
  IP address of the client when an item is submitted. `"full"` again is the default and the current
  behaviour where the full IP address of the client is gathered. `"anonymize"` takes the same IP
  address and masks out the least significant bits. `"none"` implies that the client IP is not
  captured.

  See [#144](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-java/pull/144)

- Better support for configuring the `rollbar-logback` integration as well as the ability to easily
  set the endpoint for submitting items directly on the Configuration object.
  See [#143](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-java/pull/143)
